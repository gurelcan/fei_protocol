# fei_protocol
A Model to Examine Stability, Safety, Efficiency of FEI Protocol

Aggregates all users as 1 (that is 1 user, 1 protocol)
Includes all logic and formulas (direct mint/burn incentives, reweight, bonding curve, pcv/uniswap)
Shows protocol protocol metrics (FEIu, FEIb, FEIp, Liq Ratio, Effective price) at any given time
Shows user metrics (invested ETH, holded/pooled FEI etc.)
Next versions will perform sensitivity analysis on stability, safety and efficiency of the protocol
